# Subly Front End Challenge

The main purpose of this challenge was to demonstrate my Javascript and React skills. I created a simple one-page app that relies on a reusable card component. The main page fetches  information from Subly's API and then loops through it to dynamically create a series of cards. A live version of this app can be found [here](https://sublytask.vercel.app/).

## Some Notes

I tried to imitate the designs on the challenge PDF as closely as possible. This wasn't always possible. I was able to find a couple of icons that were free for use without attribution and edit one slightly with Figma.

The transcription loading bar fills up on a timer.

The drop down filter menus are currently not functional. The filter method I initially used was flawed and so due to time constraints I've removed it for the time being.

Given more time, I would also have liked to implement error handling for the fetch function and a set of tests.
