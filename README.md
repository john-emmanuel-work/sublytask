# Subly Front End Challenge

The main purpose of this challenge was to demonstrate my React skills. I created a simple one-page app that relies on a reusable card component. The main page fetches  information from Subly's API and then loops through it to dynamically create a series of cards. A live version of this app can be found [here]([https://www.google.com](https://sublytask.vercel.app/).
